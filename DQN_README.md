# Running
Run Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search solution with below
Run Deep Q Network solution with below
```
python3 Battleship.py deep_game.json
```

- Remember to have Pytorch and Tensorboard Installed

Load tensorboard with the following:
```
tensorboard --logdir='run\'
```

# Objective

Makes the Deep Q Network with the best approximator of the Q* 

# Future Improvements

Using this code, it can be extended into doing a DRQN Network
